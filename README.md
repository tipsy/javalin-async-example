# javalin-async-example

This repo contains a benchmarking tool created for playing around with futures in [Javalin](https://javalin.io).

It's only intended as an illustration of the concepts of running requests asynchronously. Since your browser is being used
as a benchmarking tool results will become wildly inaccurate if you try to send too many requests.
